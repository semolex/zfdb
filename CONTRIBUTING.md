## Let's Try To Use [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)

Pull requests are appreciated. Welcome your pull requests:
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Please, use [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) and [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/semolex/zfdb/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/semolex/zfdb/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Always use [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/)
* Annotate types whether it is possible.
* Docstring are in [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) format.
